I hadnt used any kind of MacOS since High Sierra and it was again with a Hackintosh with a Ryzen. So I thought to give BigSur a try. 
Everything seems to be working fine. Including Sleep. Just remember to add your serial number etc. You know how. 
Mic is working too since I have VoodooHDA. Sound quality seems the same to be honest.
